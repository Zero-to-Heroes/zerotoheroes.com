<div class="formatting-help">
	<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdow syntax</a> to format your text</p>
	<p>Additionally, you can:
		<ul>
			<li>Enter time information in the form mm:ss to create a link to directly go to the specified time in the video (e.g. <i>01:21</i> will create a link to go to 1 min 21 seconds into the video).</li>
			<li>Add <i>+p</i> after a time information to automatically start playing the video at that time when clicking on the link</li>
			<li>Or add <i>+s</i> to start playing in slow motion (half speed)</li>
			<li>Or add <i>+s</i> with a number to specify the video playback rate. For instance, <i>+s0.25</i> will play the video at quarter the speed, while <i>+s2</i> will play it at double the speed</li>
			<li>Add <i>L</i> after any of +p or +s commands to start a 5-seconds loop starting from the timestamp. You can also specify the loop duration in the same format as for <i>+s</i>. For instance, <i>00:54+s0.25L2.2</i> will start playing the video at 54s in at quarter the speed, and loop every 2.2 seconds</li>
		</ul>
